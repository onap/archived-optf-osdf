      "message": "I think the policy models shouldn\u0027t be loaded every time when health check is called. The models are supposed to be uploaded only when a new model is added or updated in case of changes to any existing model. \nPolicies are also required to be recreated/updated with latest model version when there is any model change.\n\nAlso, the health check can be performed by other applications or clients/users. We should restrict them to update OSDF models unknowingly.\n\nI would suggest to add another endpoint to upload models and call whenever it is required (may be as a part of the OSDF deployment)",
